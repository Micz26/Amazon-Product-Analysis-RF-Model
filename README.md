# Amazon-Products-Analysis-RF-Model

The core objective of this project is to identify potential products suitable for sale on Amazon. This is achieved through an analysis of real data acquired from Amazon Product Search via the RapidAPI service. By utilizing data analysis techniques, the project aims to uncover insights that assist in recognizing optimal products for selling. Metrics including ratings, prices, total reviews, best seller status, and more will be scrutinized to reveal patterns that inform strategic choices and refine product positioning.

The project also involves comparing revenue, demand, and ratings against other products. Moreover, it employs a Random Forest model to predict the potential success of a product in the market.

Through this holistic analysis, the project seeks to offer actionable insights that steer effective business strategies and aid in the selection of the most advantageous products for the market.
